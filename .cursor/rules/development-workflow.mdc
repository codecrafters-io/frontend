When you're asked to make changes, follow these rules:

- Say consistent with the rest of our codebase. Read other files to understand what our patterns are.
- Don't run tests using `npm test`, those are extremely slow. Just use `npm run lint` instead.
- Don't run commands like `npm run build` / `npm run start`.
