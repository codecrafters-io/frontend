When you're asked to make changes, follow these rules:

- Say consistent with the rest of our codebase. Read other files to understand what our patterns are.
- Run `npm run lint` after making changes.
- Once linting is successful, you can try running tests if there are ones that cover the area you changed.
  - Use `npx run ember test --module '<module-name>'` to run tests.
  - If you know the test file, the module name is at the top (`module('...', function (hooks) { ... })`)
  - If you're unsure about the test file, ask me.
- Don't run `npm run test`, that's super slow.
- Don't run commands like `npm run build` / `npm run start`.
