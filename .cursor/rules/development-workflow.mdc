When you're asked to make changes, follow these rules:

- Say consistent with the rest of our codebase. Read other files to understand what our patterns are.
- Run `npm run lint:fix` after making changes.
  - You can ignore any `pauseTest()` related failures. These are needed for debugging purposes.
- Once linting is successful, you can try running tests if there are ones that cover the area you changed.
  - Only run tests using the browser tool.
  - Visit `http://localhost:4200/tests?filter=xyz` to run tests in the browser.
  - You MUST use the filter query param to filter for the tests you want to run. Do NOT run all tests.
  - You can use the console to check for any errors, you'll also see them printed on the page most of the time.
- Do NOT run `npm run test`, that's super slow.
- Do NOT run commands like `npm run build` / `npm run start`.
