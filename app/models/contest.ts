1. When you pass any stage in a CodeCrafters challenge, you automatically become eligible to
win the prize for the ongoing CodeCrafters Contest. There is no separate registration required.

2. Passing each new stage automatically adds points to your score. The number of points awarded depends on the difficulty of the stage:
  - Easy: 15 points
  - Medium: 25 points
  - Difficult: 45 points

3. Points can only be awarded once per unique stage, regardless of language. If you have passed the same stage before, you wonâ€™t accrue points.

4. Points reset once the ongoing contest ends.

5. When your score is in the Top 15 for the week, your progress and score will be highlighted on the leaderboard.

6. At the end of the contest, the developer with the top score wins the prize. In the event of a tie, the winner will be chosen randomly.

7. CodeCrafters has rigorous checks in place for detecting plagiarism and other malicious tactics. Any such activity will result in a 1 year ban from Contests.
