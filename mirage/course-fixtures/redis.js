When RDB persistence is enabled, the Redis server syncs its in-memory state with an RDB file, by doing the following:\n\n1.  On startup, the Redis server loads the data from the RDB file.\n2.  While running, the Redis server periodically takes new snapshots of the dataset, in order to update the RDB file.\n\n###  `dir` and `dbfilename`\n\nThe configuration parameters `dir` and `dbfilename` specify where an RDB file is stored:\n-   `dir` - the path to the directory where the RDB file is stored (example: `/tmp/redis-data`)\n-   `dbfilename` - the name of the RDB file (example: `rdbfile`)\n\n### The `CONFIG GET` command\n\nThe [`CONFIG GET`](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/config-get/) command returns the values of configuration parameters.\n\nIt takes in one or more configuration parameters and returns a [RESP array](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/#arrays) of key-value pairs:\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli CONFIG GET dir\n1) \"dir\"\n2) \"/tmp/redis-data\"\n```\n\nAlthough `CONFIG GET` can fetch multiple parameters at a time, the tester will only send `CONFIG GET` commands with one parameter at a time.\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tester will execute your program like this:\n\n```bash\n./spawn_redis_server.sh --dir /tmp/redis-files --dbfilename dump.rdb\n```\n\nIt'll then send the following commands:\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli CONFIG GET dir\n$ redis-cli CONFIG GET dbfilename\n```\n\nYour server must respond to each `CONFIG GET` command with a RESP array containing two elements:\n\n1.  The parameter **name**, encoded as a [RESP Bulk string](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/#bulk-strings)\n2.  The parameter **value**, encoded as a RESP Bulk string\n\nFor example, if the value of `dir` is `/tmp/redis-files`, then the expected response to `CONFIG GET dir` is:\n\n```bash\n*2\\r\\n$3\\r\\ndir\\r\\n$16\\r\\n/tmp/redis-files\\r\\n\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n1.  You don't need to read the RDB file in this stage, you only need to store `dir` and `dbfilename`. Reading from the file will be covered in later stages.\n2.  If your repository was created before 5th Oct 2023, it's possible that your `./spawn_redis_server.sh` script is not passing arguments to your program. To fix this, you'll need to edit `./spawn_redis_server.sh`. Check the [update CLI args PR](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/pull/89/files) for details on how to do this.\n",

We'll assume that the master's database is always empty,\nand just hardcode an empty RDB file to send to the replica.\n\nYou can find the hex representation of an empty RDB file [here](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/redis-tester/blob/main/internal/assets/empty_rdb_hex.md).\n\nThe tester will accept any valid RDB file that is empty, you don't need to send the exact file above.\n\nThe file is sent using the following format:\n\n```\n$<length_of_file>\\r\\n<contents_of_file>\n```\n\n(This is similar to how [Bulk Strings](https://redis.io/topics/protocol#resp-bulk-strings) are encoded, but without the trailing `\\r\\n`)\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tester will execute your program like this:\n\n```\n./spawn_redis_server.sh --port <PORT>\n```\n\nIt'll then connect to your TCP server as a replica and execute the following commands:\n\n1. `PING` (expecting `+PONG\\r\\n` back)\n2. `REPLCONF listening-port <PORT>` (expecting `+OK\\r\\n` back)\n3. `REPLCONF capa eof capa psync2` (expecting `+OK\\r\\n` back)\n4. `PSYNC ? -1` (expecting `+FULLRESYNC <REPL_ID> 0\\r\\n` back)\n\nAfter receiving a response to the last command, the tester will expect to receive an empty RDB file from your server.\n\n### Notes\n\n- The [RDB file link](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/redis-tester/blob/main/internal/assets/empty_rdb_hex.md) contains hex & base64 representations\n  of the file. You need to decode these into binary contents before sending it to the replica.\n- The RDB file should be sent like this: `$<length>\\r\\n<contents>`\n  - `<length>` is the length of the file in bytes\n  - `<contents>` is the contents of the file\n  - Note that this is NOT a RESP bulk string, it doesn't contain a `\\r\\n` at the end\n- If you want to learn more about the RDB file format, read [this blog post](https://rdb.fnordig.de/file_format.html).

The\nreplica processes the command and updates its state. More on how this propagation works in the\n\"Replication connection\" section below.\n\nCommands like `PING`, `ECHO` etc. are not considered \"write\" commands, so they aren't propagated. Commands like\n`SET`, `DEL` etc. are considered \"write\" commands, so they are propagated.\n\n### Replication connection\n\nCommand propagation happens over the replication connection. This is the same connection that was used for the handshake.\n\nPropagated commands are sent as RESP arrays. For example, if the master receives `SET foo bar` as a command from a client,\nit'll send `*3\\r\\n$3\\r\\nSET\\r\\n$3\\r\\nfoo\\r\\n$3\\r\\nbar\\r\\n` to all connected replicas over their respective replication connections.\n\nReplicas process commands received over the replication connection just like they would process commands received from a client,\nbut with one difference: Replicas don't send responses back to the master. They just process the command silently and update their\nstate.\n\nSimilarly, the master doesn't wait for a response from the replica when propagating commands. It just keeps sending commands as they\ncome in.\n\nThere is one exception to this \"no response\" rule, the `REPLCONF GETACK` command. We'll learn about this in later stages.\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tester will execute your program like this:\n\n```\n./spawn_redis_server.sh --port <PORT>\n```\n\nIt'll then connect to your TCP server as a replica and execute the following commands:\n\n1. `PING` (expecting `+PONG\\r\\n` back)\n2. `REPLCONF listening-port <PORT>` (expecting `+OK\\r\\n` back)\n3. `REPLCONF capa eof capa psync2` (expecting `+OK\\r\\n` back)\n4. `PSYNC ? -1` (expecting `+FULLRESYNC <REPL_ID> 0\\r\\n` back)\n\nThe tester will then wait for your server to send an RDB file.\n\nOnce the RDB file is received, the tester will send series of write commands to your program (as a separate Redis client, not the replica).\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli SET foo 1\n$ redis-cli SET bar 2\n$ redis-cli SET baz 3\n```\n\nIt'll then assert that these commands were propagated to the replica, in order. The tester will\nexpect to receive these commands (encoded as RESP arrays) on the replication connection (the one used for the handshake).\n\n### Notes\n\n- A true implementation would buffer the commands so that they can be sent to the replica after it loads the RDB file. For the\n  purposes of this challenge, you can assume that the replica is ready to receive commands immediately after receiving the RDB file.\n",

For now, we'll only deal with\nexplicit IDs (like `1526919030474-0` in the example above).\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tester will execute your program like this:\n\n```bash\n$ ./spawn_redis_server.sh\n```\n\nIt'll then send an `XADD` command to your server and expect the ID as a response.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XADD stream_key 0-1 foo bar\n\"0-1\"\n```\n\nYour server should respond with `$3\\r\\n0-1\\r\\n`, which is `0-1` encoded as a [RESP bulk string](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#bulk-strings).\n\nThe tester will then send a `TYPE` command to your server.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli TYPE stream_key\n\"stream\"\n```\n\nYour server should respond with `+stream\\r\\n`, which is `stream` encoded as a [RESP simple string](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#simple-strings).\n\n### Notes\n\n- You still need to handle the \"string\" and \"none\" return values for the `TYPE` command. \"stream\" should only be returned for keys that are streams.\n",

      "description_md": "In this stage, you'll add support for validating entry IDs to the `XADD` command.\n\n### Entry IDs\n\nHere's an example of stream entries from the previous stage:\n\n```yaml\nentries:\n  - id: 1526985054069-0 # (ID of the first entry)\n    temperature: 36 # (A key value pair in the first entry)\n    humidity: 95 # (Another key value pair in the first entry)\n\n  - id: 1526985054079-0 # (ID of the second entry)\n    temperature: 37 # (A key value pair in the first entry)\n    humidity: 94 # (Another key value pair in the first entry)\n\n  # ... (and so on)\n```\n\nEntry IDs are always composed of two integers: `<millisecondsTime>-<sequenceNumber>`.\n\nEntry IDs are unique within a stream, and they're guaranteed to be incremental - i.e. an\nentry added later will always have an ID greater than an entry added in the past. More\non this in the next section.\n\n### Specifying entry IDs in XADD\n\nThere are multiple formats in which the ID can be specified in the XADD command:\n\n- Explicit (\"1526919030474-0\") (**This stage**)\n- Auto-generate only sequence number (\"1526919030474-*\") (Next stages)\n- Auto-generate time part and sequence number (\"*\") (Next stages)\n\nIn this stage, we'll only deal with explicit IDs. We'll add support for the other two cases in the next stages.\n\nYour XADD implementation should validate the ID passed in.\n\n- The ID should be greater than the ID of the last entry in the stream.\n  - The `millisecondsTime` part of the ID should be greater than or equal to the `millisecondsTime` of the last entry.\n  - If the `millisecondsTime` part of the ID is equal to the `millisecondsTime` of the last entry, the `sequenceNumber` part of the ID should be greater than the `sequenceNumber` of the last entry.\n- If the stream is empty, the ID should be greater than `0-0`\n\nHere's an example of adding an entry with a valid ID followed by an invalid ID:\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XADD some_key 1-1 foo bar\n\"1-1\"\n$ redis-cli XADD some_key 1-1 bar baz\n(error) ERR The ID specified in XADD is equal or smaller than the target stream top item\n```\n\nHere's another such example:\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XADD some_key 1-1 foo bar\n\"1-1\"\n$ redis-cli XADD some_key 0-2 bar baz\n(error) ERR The ID specified in XADD is equal or smaller than the target stream top item\n```\n\nThe minimum entry ID that Redis supports is 0-1. Passing in an ID lower than should result in an error.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XADD some_key 0-0 bar baz\n(error) ERR The ID specified in XADD must be greater than 0-0\n```\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tester will execute your program like this:\n\n```bash\n$ ./spawn_redis_server.sh\n```\n\nIt'll create a few entries usind `XADD`.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XADD stream_key 1-1 foo bar\n\"1-1\"\n$ redis-cli XADD stream_key 1-2 bar baz\n\"1-2\"\n```\n\nIt'll send another `XADD` command with the same time and sequence number as the last entry.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XADD stream_key 1-2 baz foo\n(error) ERR The ID specified in XADD is equal or smaller than the target stream top item\n```\n\nYour server should respond with \"-ERR The ID specified in XADD is equal or smaller than the target stream top item\\r\\n\", which is the error message above encoded as a\n[simple error](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#simple-errors).\n\nThe tester will then send another `XADD` command with a smaller value for the time and a larger value for the sequence number.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XADD stream_key 0-3 baz foo\n(error) ERR The ID specified in XADD is equal or smaller than the target stream top item\n```\n\nYour server should also respond with the same error message.\n\nAfter that, the tester will send another `XADD` command with `0-0` as the ID.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XADD stream_key 0-0 baz foo\n```\n\nYour server should respond with \"-ERR The ID specified in XADD must be greater than 0-0\\r\\n\", which is the error message above encoded as a\n[RESP simple error](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#simple-errors).\n",

Both are entry IDs. The command returns all entries in the\nstream with IDs between the `start` and `end` IDs. This range is \"inclusive\", which means that the response\nwill includes entries with IDs that are equal to the `start` and `end` IDs.\n\nHere's an example of how it works:\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XADD some_key 1526985054069-0 temperature 36 humidity 95\n\"1526985054069-0\" # (ID of the first added entry)\n$ redis-cli XADD some_key 1526985054079-0 temperature 37 humidity 94\n\"1526985054079-0\"\n$ redis-cli XRANGE some_key 1526985054069 1526985054079\n1) 1) 1526985054069-0\n   2) 1) temperature\n      2) 36\n      3) humidity\n      4) 95\n2) 1) 1526985054079-0\n   2) 1) temperature\n      2) 37\n      3) humidity\n      4) 94\n```\n\nThe sequence number doesn't need to be included in the start and end IDs provided to the command.

The return value is just one line.\n\n`XREAD` supports other optional arguments, but we won't deal with them right now.\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tester will execute your program like this:\n\n```bash\n$ ./spawn_redis_server.sh\n```\n\nFirst, an entry will be added.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XADD stream_key 0-1 temperature 96\n```\n\nIt'll then send an `XREAD` command to your server.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli XREAD streams stream_key 0-0\n```\n\nYour server should respond with the following:\n\n```text\n*1\\r\\n\n*2\\r\\n\n$9\\r\\nstream_key\\r\\n\n*1\\r\\n\n*2\\r\\n\n$3\\r\\n0-1\\r\\n\n*2\\r\\n\n$11\\r\\ntemperature\\r\\n\n$2\\r\\n96\\r\\n\n```\n\nThis is the RESP encoded representation of the following.\n\n```json\n[\n  [\n    \"stream_key\",\n    [\n      [\n        \"0-1\",\n        [\n          \"temperature\",\n          \"96\"\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n```\n\n### Notes\n- In the response, the items are separated onto new lines for readability.
