The path to an object is derived from its hash.\n\n  The path for the object with the hash `e88f7a929cd70b0274c4ea33b209c97fa845fdbc` would be:\n\n  ```bash\n  ./git/objects/e8/8f7a929cd70b0274c4ea33b209c97fa845fdbc\n  ```\n\n  You'll see that the file isn't placed directly in the `./git/objects` directory. Instead, it's placed in a directory named with the\n  first two characters of the object's hash. The remaining 38 characters are used as the file name.\n\n  Each Git object has its own format for storage. We'll look at how Blobs are stored in this stage, and we'll cover\n  other objects in future stages.\n</details>\n\n### Blob Object Storage\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>\n\n  Each Git Blob is stored as a separate file in the `.git/objects` directory. The file contains a header and the contents of\n  the blob object, compressed using Zlib.\n\n  The format of a blob object file looks like this (after Zlib decompression):\n\n  ```\n  blob <size>\\0<content>\n  ```\n\n  - `<size>` is the size of the content (in bytes)\n  - `\\0` is a null byte\n  - `<content>` is the actual content of the file\n\n  For example, if the contents of a file are `hello world`, the blob object file would look like this (after Zlib decompression):\n\n  ```\n  blob 11\\0hello world\n  ```\n</details>\n\n### The cat-file command\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>\n\n  In this stage, you'll read a blob from a git repository by reading its contents from the `.git/objects` directory.\n\n  You'll do this using the first of multiple [\"plumbing\" commands](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)\n  we'll encounter in this challenge: [`git cat-file`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cat-file).\n\n  `git cat-file` is used to view the type of an object, its size, and its content. Example usage:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ git cat-file -p <blob_sha>\n  hello world # This is the contents of the blob\n  ```\n\n  To implement this, you'll need to:\n\n  - Read the contents of the blob object file from the `.git/objects` directory\n  - Decompress the contents using Zlib\n  - Extract the actual \"content\" from the decompressed data\n  - Print the content to stdout\n\n</details>\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tester will first initialize a new git repository using your program:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir test_dir && cd test_dir\n$ /path/to/your_git.sh init\n```\n\nIt'll then insert a blob into the `.git/objects` directory and run your program like this:\n\n```bash\n$ ./your_git.sh cat-file -p <blob_sha>\nhello world\n```\n\nThe tester will verify that the output of your program matches the binary data that the blob contains.\n\n### Notes\n\n- In many programming languages the default print function (like [`fmt.Println`](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt#example-Println))\n  will append a newline to the output. The output of `cat-file` must not contain a\n  newline at the end, so you might need to use a different function to print the output.\n\n{{#lang_is_python}}\n- Keep in mind that Git uses [Zlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) to\n  compress objects.

Each entry includes:\n\n  - A SHA hash that points to a blob or tree object\n    - If the entry is a file, this points to a blob object\n    - If the entry is a directory, this points to a tree object\n  - The name of the file/directory\n  - The mode of the file/directory\n    - This is a simplified version of the permissions you'd see in a Unix file system.\n    - For files, the valid values are:\n        - `100644` (regular file)\n        - `100755` (executable file)\n        - `120000` (symbolic link)\n    - For directories, the value is `040000`\n    - There are other values for submodules, but we won't be dealing with those in this challenge.\n\n  For example, if you had a directory structure like this:\n\n  ```\n  your_repo/\n    - file1\n    - dir1/\n      - file_in_dir_1\n      - file_in_dir_2\n    - dir2/\n      - file_in_dir_3\n  ```\n\n  The entries in the tree object would look like this:\n\n  ```\n  040000 dir1 <tree_sha_1>\n  040000 dir2 <tree_sha_2>\n  100644 file1 <blob_sha_1>\n  ```\n\n  - Line 1 (`040000 dir1 <tree_sha_1>`) indicates that `dir1` is a directory with the SHA hash `<tree_sha_1>`\n  - Line 2 (`040000 dir2 <tree_sha_2>`) indicates that `dir2` is a directory with the SHA hash `<tree_sha_2>`\n  - Line 3 (`100644 file1 <blob_sha_1>`) indicates that `file1` is a regular file with the SHA hash `<blob_sha_1>`\n\n  `dir1` and `dir2` would be tree objects themselves, and their entries would contain the files/directories inside them.\n\n</details>\n\n### The `ls-tree` command\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>\n\n  The `git ls-tree` command is used to inspect a tree object.\n\n  For a directory structure like this:\n\n  ```\n  your_repo/\n    - file1\n    - dir1/\n      - file_in_dir_1\n      - file_in_dir_2\n    - dir2/\n      - file_in_dir_3\n  ```\n\n  The output of `git ls-tree` would look like this:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ git ls-tree <tree_sha>\n  040000 tree <tree_sha_1>\tdir1\n  040000 tree <tree_sha_2>\tdir2\n  100644 blob <blob_sha_1>\tfile1\n  ```\n\n  Note that the output is alphabetically sorted, this is how Git stores entries in the tree object internally.\n\n  In this stage you'll implement the `git ls-tree` command with the `--name-only` flag. Here's how the output looks with\n  the `--name-only` flag:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ git ls-tree --name-only <tree_sha>\n  dir1\n  dir2\n  file1\n  ```\n\n  The tester uses `--name-only` since this output format is easier to test against.\n\n  We recommend implementing the full `ls-tree` output too since that'll require that you parse all data\n  in the tree object, not just filenames.\n\n</details>\n\n### Tree Object Storage\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>\n\n  Just like blobs, tree objects are stored in the `.git/objects` directory.

They're just raw bytes (20 bytes long).\n- In a tree object file, entries are sorted by their name. The output of `ls-tree` matches this order.",

Each entry is of the form `<mode> <name>\\0<sha>`.\n    - `<mode>` is the mode of the file/directory\n    - `<name>` is the name of the file/directory\n    - `\\0` is a null byte\n    - `<20_byte_sha>` is the 20-byte SHA-1 hash of the blob/tree (this is **not** in hexadecimal format)\n\n  You can read more about the internal format of a tree object [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14790681/what-is-the-internal-format-of-a-git-tree-object).\n\n</details>\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tester will initialize a new Git repository using your program:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir test_dir && cd test_dir\n$ /path/to/your_git.sh init\n```\n\nIt'll create some random files and directories:\n\n```bash\n$ echo \"hello world\" > test_file_1.txt\n$ mkdir test_dir_1\n$ echo \"hello world\" > test_dir_1/test_file_2.txt\n$ mkdir test_dir_2\n$ echo \"hello world\" > test_dir_2/test_file_3.txt\n```\n\nAnd then run your program like this:\n\n```bash\n$ /path/to/your_git.sh write-tree\n4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904\n```\n\nYou're expected to write the entire working directory as a tree object\nand print the 40-char SHA to stdout.\n\nThe tester will verify that the output of your program matches the SHA hash\nof the tree object that the official `git` implementation would write.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Remember to ignore the `.git` directory when creating entries in the tree object.\n- Your implementation of `git write-tree` will need to handle nested directories. A recursive implementation\n  will help here, since you'll need to create tree objects for each subdirectory to be able to create the\n  parent directory's tree object.\n- The implementation of `git write-tree` here differs slightly from the official `git` implementation. The\n  official `git` implementation uses the staging area to determine what to write to the tree object. We'll\n  just assume that all files in the working directory are staged.",
